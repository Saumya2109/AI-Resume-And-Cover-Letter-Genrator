This project also supports image embedding (like a profile photo) and a choice between simple and \"fancy\" template designs.\n","\n","Key Features:\n","\n","Collects comprehensive resume data: personal info, education, work experience, skills, and additional sections (projects, awards, etc.).\n","\n","Offers option to upload and embed a profile photo.\n","\n","Supports both simple and styled (fancy) PDF templates.\n","\n","Converts the final PDF to an image (JPG) using ImageMagick.\n","\n","Allows download of generated files in PDF or JPG format.\n","\n","Optionally uploads generated resume/image to Google Drive under a dedicated folder.\n","\n","User-friendly prompts for all interactions — no manual coding needed by end-users.\n","\n","Use Cases:\n","\n","Students or job-seekers who need a quick, customizable resume builder.\n","\n","People without access to professional resume tools like Canva, Overleaf, or MS Word.\n","\n","Individuals interested in embedding profile photos and downloading resumes in image format for platforms like LinkedIn or job portals."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"32bx0KKyrJfk"},"source":["Implementation
